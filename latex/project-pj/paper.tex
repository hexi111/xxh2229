\section{Make}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The best way to create the documents is form the commandline (under windows you can install miktex and cygwin). Make sure you have make installed. Once that is done you can craete the contents while modifying the following files in teh directory.

\begin{description}

\item[paper.tex:] contents of the paper you will write
\item[vonLaszewski-template.tex:] real name of the latex file that includes the contents from paper.tex. In teh final version the \verb|template| shoudl be replaced with something more meaningful and the Makefile shoud be updated. Do not modify the contents of this file too much other than changing title and authors. Typically {\em Gregor von Laszewski} is always a coauthor.

\end{description}

To create the file and view the pdf file say

\begin{verbatim}
$ make
$ make view
\end{verbatim}
