\begin{center}{\Large Credit Transfer Request}\end{center}
The following is the information of courses that I took when I pursued my master degree in South China Normal University, China. I would like to transfer these course credits to Galisano College of  Computing and Information Sciences, RIT.

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{normalsize}
\begin {tabular} {|c|c|p{8.5cm}|}
\hline 
{\em \bf Name} & {\em \bf Grade} &{\em \bf ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Description}\\
\hline
Modern Network Technology&95&An introduction to the modern network technology, such as Layer 3 Switch, and MPLS. \\
\hline
Advanced Database System&98&A study of database management systems (DBMS) related algorithms\\
\hline
Grid Computing&86&Basic concept of Grid Computing \\
\hline
Network Security&80& A study of network security technology\\
\hline
Web Services&83& A introduction of protocols, principle and application of Web Services \\
\hline
Distributed Computing&88&The course covers distributed system architectures and distribution system design issues such as communication and deadlock \\
\hline
Logic Principle&80&A brief introduction of mathematical logic.  \\
\hline
\end {tabular}
\end{normalsize}
\end{center}
\end {table}

These courses are all related to the research I am conducting in the program. They are conducted on a semester basis, and I think each of them is equal to a 4 credits course in RIT whose courses are based on a quarter basis.
