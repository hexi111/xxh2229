	desired. Fortran 90 along with the Message Passing Interface was
	used to develop a parallel library that allows parallelization of
	the system. This library includes a parallel I/O and a parallel vector
	set of routines with an HPF-like interface. A parallel sorting and
	a restoring routine was also incorporated into the library. This
	library also increases the portability of the code for MIMD supercomputers.},

	to acquire complete tomographic data sets at 100 nm or better resolution
	in a few minutes. To take advantage of such high-brilliance sources
	at the Advanced Photon Source, we have constructed a pipelined data
	acquisition and reconstruction system that combines a fast detector
	system, high-speed data networks, and massively parallel computers
	to rapidly acquire the projection data and perform the reconstruction
	and rendering calculations. With the current setup, a data set can
	be obtained and reconstructed in tens of minutes. A specialized visualization
	computer makes rendered three-dimensional (3D) images available to
	the beamline users minutes after the data acquisition is completed.
	This system is capable of examining a large number of samples at
	sub-pm 3D resolution or studying the full 3D structure of a dynamically
	evolving sample on a 10 mm temporal scale. In the near future, we
	expect to increase the spatial resolution to below 100 nm by using
	zone-plate x-ray focusing optics and to improve the time resolution
	by the use of a broadband x-ray monochromator and a faster detector
	system. (c) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},
