  abstract = {Most scientists conduct analyses and run models in several different
	software and hardware environments, mentally coordinating the export
	and import of data from one environment to another. The Kepler scientific
	workflow system provides domain scientists with an easy-to-use yet
	powerful system for capturing scientific workflows (SWFs). SWFs are
	a formalization of the ad-hoc process that a scientist may go through
	to get from raw data to publishable results. Kepler attempts to streamline
	the workflow creation and execution process so that scientists can
	design, execute, monitor, re-run, and communicate analytical procedures
	repeatedly with minimal effort. Kepler is unique in that it seamlessly
	combines high-level workflow design with execution and runtime interaction,
	access to local and remote data, and local and remote service invocation.
	SWFs are superficially similar to business process workflows but
	have several challenges not present in the business workflow scenario.
	For example, they often operate on large, complex and heterogeneous
	data, can be computationally intensive and produce complex derived
	data products that may be archived for use in reparameterized runs
	or other workflows. Moreover, unlike business workflows, SWFs are
	often dataflow-oriented as witnessed by a number of recent academic
	systems (e.g., DiscoveryNet, Taverna and Triana) and commercial systems
	(Scitegic/Pipeline-Pilot, Inforsense). In a sense, SWFs are often
	closer to signal-processing and data streaming applications than
	they are to control-oriented business workflow applications.},

	driven role based access control, thus presenting a new security

	and security of a high performance distributed storage system. We
	have previously designed a distributed parallel storage system that
	employs the aggregate bandwidth of multiple data servers connected
	by a high speed wide area network to achieve scalability and high
	data throughput. The general approach of the paper employs erasure
	error correcting codes to add data redundancy that can be used to
	retrieve missing information caused by hardware, software, or human
	faults. The paper suggests techniques for reducing the communication
	and computation overhead incurred while retrieving missing data blocks
	form redundant information. These techniques include clustering,
	multidimensional coding, and the full two dimensional parity scheme},

  abstract = { The high performance storage system (HPSS) provides scalable hierarchical
	storage management (HSM), archive, and file system services. Its
	design, implementation and current dominant use are focused on HSM
	and archive services. It is also a general-purpose, global, shared,
	parallel file system, potentially useful in other application domains.
	When HPSS design and implementation began over a decade ago, scientific
	computing power and storage capabilities at a site, such as a DOE
	national laboratory, was measured in a few 10 s of gigaops, data
	archived in HSMs in a few 10 s of terabytes at most, data throughput
	rates to an HSM in a few megabytes/s, and daily throughput with the
	HSM in a few gigabytes/day. At that time, the DOE national laboratories
	and IBM HPSS design team recognized that we were headed for a data
	storage explosion driven by computing power rising to teraops/petaops
	requiring data stored in HSMs to rise to petabytes and beyond, data
	transfer rates with the HSM to rise to gigabytes/s and higher, and
	daily throughput with a HSM in 10 s of terabytes/day. This paper
	discusses HPSS architectural, implementation and deployment experiences
	that contributed to its success in meeting the above orders of magnitude
	scaling targets. We also discuss areas that need additional attention
	as we continue significant scaling into the future.},
